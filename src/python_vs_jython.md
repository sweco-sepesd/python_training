*"Jython is a Java implementation of Python"* [www.jython.org](https://www.jython.org/index)

*"Although Jython implements the Python language specification, it has some differences and incompatibilities with CPython, which is the reference implementation of Python"* [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jython#Status_and_roadmap)

*"CPython is the reference implementation of the Python programming language. Written in C and Python, CPython is the default and most widely used implementation of the language."* [wikipeia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython)
